Step 1: Find average amount paid by the top 5 customers

SELECT AVG(total_payment) AS avg_amount_paid_top_five_customers
FROM (
    SELECT
      B.customer_id,
      B.first_name AS customer_first_name,
      B.last_name AS customer_last_name,
      D.city,
      E.country,
      SUM(A.amount) AS total_payment
    FROM payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
    WHERE D.city IN (
        SELECT C.city
        FROM customer A
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        WHERE D.country IN (
            SELECT D.country
            FROM customer A
            INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
            INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
            INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
            GROUP BY D.country
            ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
        GROUP BY C.city
        ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
    ORDER BY total_payment DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS average;


Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country

Final output should include 3 columns:

“country”
“all_customer_count” with total number of customers in each country
“Top_customer_count” showing how many of the top 5 customers live in each country

SELECT
    E.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer B
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        B.customer_id,
        E.country
    FROM payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
    WHERE D.city IN (
        SELECT C.city
        FROM customer A
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        WHERE D.country IN (
            SELECT D.country
            FROM customer A
            INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
            INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
            INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
            GROUP BY D.country
            ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
        GROUP BY C.city
        ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, E.country
    ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS top_5_customers ON E.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY E.country;
