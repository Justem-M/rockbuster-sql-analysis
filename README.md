SQL data analysis project for Rockbuster Stealth, a fictional video rental company

# 🎬 Rockbuster Stealth SQL Data Analysis

## Overview

This SQL project was developed as part of a data analytics course and is based on a fictional company, **Rockbuster Stealth LLC** — a former global movie rental chain. Facing growing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster plans to transition to an online video rental service.

As a data analyst in Rockbuster’s Business Intelligence (BI) department, I supported the company's launch strategy by using SQL to extract business insights from their relational database.

## Objectives

The project aimed to:
- Load Rockbuster’s existing data into a PostgreSQL relational database.
- Explore customer, rental, and payment data using SQL queries.
- Answer strategic business questions to inform the company's 2020 online launch plan.
- Present findings through visualisation and storytelling, using Tableau and Excel.

## Key Business Questions Addressed

- 🎥 Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?
- ⏱️ What is the average rental duration for all films?
- 🌍 In which countries are Rockbuster's customers based?
- 💸 Where are the customers with the highest lifetime value?
- 📊 Do sales figures vary across geographic regions?

## Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** – for setting up and querying the relational database
- **SQL** – for exploratory and targeted data analysis
- **Excel** – for creating supporting visuals and compiling deliverables
- **Tableau** – for final visual presentation of insights
