SQL data analysis project for Rockbuster Stealth, a fictional video rental company

 Rockbuster Stealth SQL Data Analysis 

 

Overview 

This project was developed as part of a data analytics course and is based on a fictional company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental chain. With growing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster plans to relaunch as an online video rental service. 

As a data analyst in the company's Business Intelligence (BI) department, I was tasked with supporting the launch strategy by using SQL to extract insights from their existing database. 

 

Objectives 

The project involved: 

Loading Rockbuster’s existing relational database into PostgreSQL. 

Writing SQL queries to explore and analyse customer behaviour, revenue performance, and geographic patterns. 

Answering key business questions from Rockbuster’s management to guide strategic decisions. 

 

Key Business Questions Addressed 

Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue? 

What is the average rental duration across all titles? 

Where are Rockbuster’s customers located? 

Which customers have the highest lifetime value? 

Do sales figures differ by geographic region? 

 

Tools Used 

PostgreSQL (for database setup and querying) 

SQL (for data extraction and analysis) 

Excel (for visualisation and final presentation of insights)
